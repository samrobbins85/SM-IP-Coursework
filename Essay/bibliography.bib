	abstract = {We propose a new measure, the method noise, to evaluate and compare the performance of digital image denoising methods. We ﬁrst compute and analyze this method noise for a wide class of denoising algorithms, namely the local smoothing ﬁlters. Second, we propose a new algorithm, the non local means ({NL}-means), based on a non local averaging of all pixels in the image. Finally, we present some experiments comparing the {NL}-means algorithm and the local smoothing ﬁlters.},

	abstract = {We present in this paper a new denoising method called non-local means. The method is based on a simple principle: replacing the color of a pixel with an average of the colors of similar pixels. But the most similar pixels to a given pixel have no reason to be close at all. It is therefore licit to scan a vast portion of the image in search of all the pixels that really resemble the pixel one wants to denoise. The paper presents two implementations of the method and displays some results.},

	abstract = {The search for eﬃcient image denoising methods is still a valid challenge at the crossing of functional analysis and statistics. In spite of the sophistication of the recently proposed methods, most algorithms have not yet attained a desirable level of applicability. All show an outstanding performance when the image model corresponds to the algorithm assumptions but fail in general and create artifacts or remove image ﬁne structures. The main focus of this paper is, ﬁrst, to deﬁne a general mathematical and experimental methodology to compare and classify classical image denoising algorithms and, second, to propose a nonlocal means (NL-means) algorithm addressing the preservation of structure in a digital image. The mathematical analysis is based on the analysis of the “method noise,” deﬁned as the diﬀerence between a digital image and its denoised version. The NL-means algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal under a generic statistical image model. The denoising performance of all considered methods are compared in four ways; mathematical: asymptotic order of magnitude of the method noise under regularity assumptions; perceptual-mathematical: the algorithms artifacts and their explanation as a violation of the image model; quantitative experimental: by tables of L2 distances of the denoised version to the original image. The most powerful evaluation method seems, however, to be the visualization of the method noise on natural images. The more this method noise looks like a real white noise, the better the method.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for video denoising that exploits temporal and spatial redundancy. The proposed method is based on non-local means (NLM). NLM methods have been applied successfully in various image denoising applications. In the single-frame NLM method, each output pixel is formed as a weighted sum of the center pixels of neighboring patches, within a given search window. The weights are based on the patch intensity vector distances. The process requires computing vector distances for all of the patches in the search window. Direct extension of this method from 2D to 3D, for video processing, can be computationally demanding. Note that the size of a 3D search window is the size of the 2D search window multiplied by the number of frames being used to form the output. Exploiting a large number of frames in this manner can be prohibitive for real-time video processing. Here, we propose a novel recursive NLM (RNLM) algorithm for video processing. Our RNLM method takes advantage of recursion for computational savings, compared with the direct 3D NLM. However, like the 3D NLM, our method is still able to exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy for improved performance, compared with 2D NLM. In our approach, the first frame is processed with single-frame NLM. Subsequent frames are estimated using a weighted sum of pixels from the current frame and a pixel from the previous frame estimate. Only the single best matching patch from the previous estimate is incorporated into the current estimate. Several experimental results are presented here to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in terms of quantitative and subjective image quality.},

Machine learning: an introduction to mean squared error and regression lines
Introduction {imageIntroduction}
This article will deal with the statistical method mean squared error, and I’ll
describe the relationship of this method to the regression line.

The example consists of points on the Cartesian axis. We will define a
mathematical function that will give us the straight line that passes best
between all points on the Cartesian axis.

And in this way, we will learn the conn},
