# Software Methodologies Image Processing Coursework

The non-local means algorithm was proposed as a simple yet effective image denoising method based on the principle of replacing the colour of a pixel with an average of the colours of "similar" pixels

Based on independent literature, and experimentation with the OpenCV implementation of non-local means denoising, write a report containing:

1. A description of the non-local means algorithm
2. Discussion of the various proposed implementations of the algorithm and discussion of their efficiency
3. Demonstration of the influence of the algorithmic parameters on the output
4. Discussion of the strengths and limitations of non-local means compared to other denoising algorithms
5. Description and discussion of modifications and extensions of the algorithm that have been proposed in the literature
6. Description and discussion of applications of the original algorithm and its extensions

The report should contain examples of images denosied by the OpenCV implementation of the algorithm.
